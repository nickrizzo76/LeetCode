SOLUTION: 
Once again, we're avoiding the naive nÂ³ approach.

The solution I came up with is what I later found out to be called the 'Sliding Window Opmitized' solution.  The core of which works by mapping the characters to a dictionary (JS Object) with each letter's value being its index in the string.
